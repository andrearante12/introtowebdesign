# Intro to Web Design

Welcome to Introduction to Web Design! Here, you will learn the fundamentals of building attractive web pages. First we will briefly familiazrize ourselves with HTML, the core structure behind every website. Then, we will dive headfirst into CSS, the main focus of this course. Topics will cover a wide array of topics from basic colors and The Box Model to Flexbox and Transitions.

THIS IS JUST A TEMPORARY PLACE TO STORE COURSE DETAILS. I AM CURRENTLY BUILDING A WEBSITE FOR EASIER ACCESS.

week8 is currently planned to be some sort of catchup/extra topics/possible final project week. We will see how I feel about the course timewise when I have finished organizing the notes + demonstrations

# How to use?

Slides will only be used briefly to introduce topics and present images.

<b>TODO Guided, code-a-long demonstrations will take up the majority of the class</b>

Projects will typically be some sort of independent challenge to build off of the webpage built during demonstrations.

Notes exist mostly for my own reference during demonstrations, but also serve as student aids.
